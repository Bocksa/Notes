        <p id="standard">When plant cells are placed in salty water (a concentrated solutions), they lose turgor and become weaker. The cells are said to<br>
            be plasmolysed. If plant cells lose turgor, plant is seen to wilt. This is temporary and can be reversed by placing plant cells in<br>
            less concentrated solutions than their cell contents e.d. water them</p>
