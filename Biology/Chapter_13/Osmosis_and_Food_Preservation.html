        <p>Bacteria and fungi both have cell walls. If they are placed in a very concentrated solution they will lose water by osmosis. This<br>
            prevents them from growing and causing food to decay. There are two main examples of this process.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Soaking Food in very salty solutions<ul><li>Preserves fish and meat such as bacon</li></ul></li>
            <li>High Sugar Content<ul><li>Such as jam and marmalade. Preserves them from fungus decay</li></ul></li>
