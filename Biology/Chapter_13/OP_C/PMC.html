        <p id="standard">Cytoplasm of plant cells contain salts, sugars, starch, proteins and other molecules dissolved in water. If a plant cell is placed in<br>
            distilled water or a solution less concentrated than its cytoplasm then water will move into the cell due to osmosis. This is the<br>
            way root cells absorb water from soil.<br> 
            Water will pass into the vacuole. The cytoplasm and vacuole will swell and the cell membrane will be forced against the cell wall.<br>
            The cell is now much stronger or firmer due to its turgor pressure. The cell is said to be turgid. This can be compared to air<br>
            being forced into a car tyre<br>
            <br>Turor or Turgor Pressure is the pressure of the cytoplasm and vacuole against the cell wall</p>
