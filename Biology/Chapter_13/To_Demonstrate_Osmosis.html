        <ol>
            <li>Soak length of visking tubing in water (visking tubing is a semi-permeable membrane and soaking it makes it soft and <br>
            pliable)</li>
            <li>Tie a knot in one end of visking tubing</li>
            <li>Fill with starch solution whose molecules are too big to pass through the tubing</li>
            <li>Seal the other end of visking tubing</li>
            <li>Dry the tube and weigh it. Note how full it is</li>
            <li>Place the tubing in a beaker of distilled water</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 1-5 except fill the visking tubing with distilled water to act as control</li>
            <li>Leave apparatus for about 30 mins</li>
            <li>Remove the tubes from the water, dry them and weight hem</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="standard"><b>Results:</b> Tubing with starch solution expands and becomes more full. It gains weight - this happens because water moves due<br>
        to osmosis from a high water concentration to a low water concentration in the visking tubing</p>
