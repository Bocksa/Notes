                <li><b>Enzymes are a protein, biological catalyst</b> produced by cells (on the ribosomes)</li>
                <li>Enzymes are <b>specific</b> i.e. <b>they only work on one particular reaction or substrate (specificity)</b></li>
                <li><b>Control Metabolic Reactions</b></li>
                <li>They are affected <b>by pH</b> and by <b>temperature</b></li>
                <li><b>Optimum is the condition at which they work best</b> (not fastest). Beyond this their activity decreases</li>
                <li>Eventually they become <b>denatured</b> as their <b>shape changes permanently and they become inactive.</b></li>
